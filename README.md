# Summaries #
## Linear Trends ##

Explore time series and make predictions with a trend-line.

- What is a Time Series?
- Plotting Time Series
- Fitting a Trend-Line
- Forecasting

## Decomposing Time Series ##

Discover the parts of a time series.

- Trend
  - Linear and Nonlinear
- Seasonal
  - Recurrence plots
