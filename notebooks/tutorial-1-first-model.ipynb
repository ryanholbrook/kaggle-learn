    "# What is a Time Series? #\n",
    "\n",
    "A **time series** is simply a sequence of observations together with the times those observations occured. The times provide an **index** to the observations. Usually, the observations will have been made over some fixed time interval, like every hour or every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series are very common. They occur virtually anywhere data is collected sequentially over time. They have been used to analyze and predict: economic growth, volatility in financial markets, neural behavior, natural disasters like earthquakes and volcanoes, and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "What characterizes time series is that their observations are sequentially **dependent**. That is, the ordering of the observations is important. This is in contrast to ordinary data sets where the rows can be taken in any order without affecting the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series analysis is mostly about working with the extra information that this time dependence provides. Over this micro-course, you'll learn about a number of models especially designed for time series and what to do to make sure you get the most from your data."
